# Gromacs Simulations
This repository houses a collection of Gromacs commands which are annotated to be maximally accessible. To run any of the 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in this repository, you need to install Gromacs (here we use 4.6.5) and the VMD visualisation program. 

Additionally, you will need an install of Python 2.X (we use 2.7) with packages numpy, sys, and MDAnalysis.

Note: Results directory contains huge files, so it is excluded from this repository. These files are saved on Box.
