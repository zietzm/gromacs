We have started using functional prefixes for each file to make things 
more simple and clear.

The prefixes are as follows:
* em- energy minimization files
* gmx- general gromacs output files from python, etc. not mdrun.
* md- bigger molecular dynamics run files
* py- python files
* str- initial input structure files
* top- topology input files. Both structure and position restraints
